## PROXYROT

# What is this?
Proxyrot is designed to turn one IP address into a large number of IP
addresses.  Socks proxies are cheap (you can even find them open and free
online), and this container is designed to route traffic to a random proxy in a
list of proxies to spread web traffic across a large number of random IP
addresses.  This is useful for getting around web tracking, rate limits, and
similar pesky things.
